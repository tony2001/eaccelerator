          some parts that are forgotten with the code split are fixed. 
          They are also needed to compile eA with VC. The other stuff should make it possible 
          to compile eA as a static module for php.
        * Updated VC project files

        * Added switch -w to encoder so you can encode file without the check for eloader. This is 
          based on patch 1191147 with some fixes.

2005-04-26  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * The first part of the code refactoring. In this part the monolitic 
          eaccelerator.c file has been split up in more logical blocks.
          - cache.c/cache.h contains the procedure for shm.c/session.c/content.c to add user_cache entries to the ea cache
          - shm.c/shm.h contains the eaccelerator shared memory functions
          - session.c/session.h contains the session related stuff
          - webui.c/webui.h contains all stuff related to the webinterface and disassembler
          - debug.c/debug.h contains some procedures to print debug information
          - content.h contains the php content caching prototype instead of eaccelerator.h
        * Added --without-eaccelerator-shared-memory and  --without-eaccelerator-webui configure switches
        
        Bugfixes included:
        * Patch 1188510	eaccelerator_compile_file typos
        * Patch 1189792	session life time patch
        * Patch 1167069	HAS_ATTRIBUTE fix with FreeBSD 4.x
        * Patch 1166707	loader patch for OOP functions in PHP5
        * Patch 1173095 mm_alloc & mm_free clash with libirc
        * Fix for 1178588, 1153030 and patch 1189852. Fixes the endless loop when reseting a non array.
          The optimisation for that caused this is removed for zend engine 2 and 1 because 
          php >= 4.3.11 is also affected, so this will be useless in some time.

        * fixes 1099498 Problems with IMP H3 (Horde) when restarting apache2
