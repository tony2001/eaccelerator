2005-10-13 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed the php5 optimizer bug.
        * Changed semaphore permissions to 0666 so sysvipc locks work. Working 
          locks seem a bit more important than making the semaphore public. (#1295970)
        * Added error messages when a lock can't be aquired or released.

2005-08-03 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Included some compile fixes. (Thanks Matt)
        * Included patch from the hardened php guys to make eA work
          with hardened php.

2005-07-11 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * ea_store.c and ea_restore.c functions clean up
        * extraced restore_class_parent and restore_class_methods from
          restore_class_entry to share code with loader.c
        * extracted opcode handling in encode/decode_op_array into 
          encode/decode_op to make code more readable
        * make decode_class_entry use new functions in ea_restore.c
        * readded line-number encoding
        * bumped up encoder version to 4 until new loader is in place

2005-07-10 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Renamed some macros from MMC (mmcache) to EA (eg MMCG is now EAG)
        * Added eA file header to mm.c, mm.h and x86-spinlocks.h
        * Readded a hack to the loader to prevent zend2 segfaults

2005-07-09 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * A compile fix for php4 (bug #1235017)
        * Removed atexit code that only produced segfaults and didn't work
          (Patch from Rob Foehl <rwf at loonybin.net>)
        * Code clean up and compile fixes for VC.net + VC.net project files update
          (Based on patch #1234919)
        * Future check warning was done on uninitialised buf.
        * Some code clean ups and updated VS6 project files.

2005-07-07 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Added get_zend_destroy_property_info function to ea_restore.h
        * Code refactoring needed for the new encoder. Moved all store/calc
          functions to ea_store.c and all restore/fixup functions to ea_restore.c

2005-07-06 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * A compile fix for zend engine 1.
        * Documented namespace option
        * New debug/log code. Make the code a lot cleaner and easier
          for the user to debug eaccelerator.

2005-06-27 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed a buffer overflow in eaccelerator.c and cache.c. A string longer
          then 8 bytes was copied in a char array of length 8. This isn't a
          security risk because the overflowed bytes were directly overwritten
          by other values. This fixes bug 1228096 which was caused by the 
          bufferoverflow detection in FC4. 
          http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-09/msg02055.html

2005-06-24 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * The future check is removed because mtime are only checked on changes
          so caching files from the future isn't a problem.

2005-06-23 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Applied patch 1226111
        * Added a warning message when php scripts have a modification time in
          in the future and the debug is enabled.

2005-06-20 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Set the test value shared memory to 32mb instead of 64mb because the
          test will fail on 2.6 kernels where 32mb is the default value. (#1203253)
        * Reverted the patch for the gc_maxlifetime setting when using
          user functions for the session handler. I can't find a way to
          access the current value instead of the ini setting.
          Using the session api is the preffered session handling way anyway.

2005-05-22 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Bumped version to 0.9.4-dev
        * Changed hash_mm prototype in eaccelerator.h to non-inline (Compaq c compiler)
        * Fixes from patch 1206311 + some unused variable clean ups

2005-05-18 Franck Tabary <franck34 at users.sourceforge.net>

        * released eAccelerator 0.9.3 final

2005-05-16 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Added --without-eaccelerator-use-inode configure switch to disable the use
          of inode numbers for the hash keys (Feature request 1201159). The default
          behaviour doesn't change.
        * Fix for bug 1202296 based on patch 1202708

2005-05-15 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Compile fix for bug 1201564.

2005-05-14 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * The session lifetime patch only fixed the problem when using one type of session handler. It's now 
          also fixed for the other type of session handler.

2005-05-12 Franck Tabary <franck34 at users.sourceforge.net>

        * released eAccelerator 0.9.3-rc2

2005-05-11 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix for must constructor related problems with encoded scripts and php5. Also a fixes
          memory leak in the loader. (Thanks larnot)

2005-05-10 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>
	
        * Added some includes to satisfy VC.NET (thanks to dakalka, patch 1198522)
        * This patch adds the right destructor for the propertiesinfo hashtable, but it doesn't fix bug 1179270
        * Updated README.win32 with some extra information from Larnot

2005-05-09 Franck Tabary <franck34 at users.sourceforge.net>

        * released eAccelerator 0.9.3-rc1

2005-05-09 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixes the segfault when loading encoded script with eloader and php5
        * Commited README.win32 with instructions to compile eAccelerator on windows
        * Add the destructor to properties info hashtable in restore_class_entry, fixes bug 1179270

2005-05-06 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Patch fixing eLoader compilation.

2005-05-05 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * This patch fixes some stuff concerning configuration. With this patch 
          some parts that are forgotten with the code split are fixed. 
          They are also needed to compile eA with VC. The other stuff should make it possible 
          to compile eA as a static module for php.
        * Updated VC project files

2005-05-02  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Patch fixing php 5 constructor problems. Fixes bugs 1179264, 1121757 and 1099693
        * Added switch -w to encoder so you can encode file without the check for eloader. This is 
          based on patch 1191147 with some fixes.

2005-04-26  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * The first part of the code refactoring. In this part the monolitic 
          eaccelerator.c file has been split up in more logical blocks.
          - cache.c/cache.h contains the procedure for shm.c/session.c/content.c to add user_cache entries to the ea cache
          - shm.c/shm.h contains the eaccelerator shared memory functions
          - session.c/session.h contains the session related stuff
          - webui.c/webui.h contains all stuff related to the webinterface and disassembler
          - debug.c/debug.h contains some procedures to print debug information
          - content.h contains the php content caching prototype instead of eaccelerator.h
        * Added --without-eaccelerator-shared-memory and  --without-eaccelerator-webui configure switches
        
        Bugfixes included:
        * Patch 1188510	eaccelerator_compile_file typos
        * Patch 1189792	session life time patch
        * Patch 1167069	HAS_ATTRIBUTE fix with FreeBSD 4.x
        * Patch 1166707	loader patch for OOP functions in PHP5
        * Patch 1173095 mm_alloc & mm_free clash with libirc
        * Fix for 1178588, 1153030 and patch 1189852. Fixes the endless loop when reseting a non array.
          The optimisation for that caused this is removed for zend engine 2 and 1 because 
          php >= 4.3.11 is also affected, so this will be useless in some time.

2005-01-14  Shin Seung Woo <segv74 at gmail.com>

        * fixes 1099498 Problems with IMP H3 (Horde) when restarting apache2
          ( bug was lied on fix_zval(), it didn't check IS_CONSTANT_INDEX flag. )

2005-01-06  Shin Seung Woo <segv74 at gmail.com>

        * fix for bug 1091815. ( Encoded files and php4.3.10 )

        * 1092128 Horde-hashs int the sourcecode of eaccelerator.c
        * 1091960 include_once include files multiple times
