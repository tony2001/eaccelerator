2007-02-13  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>
        
        * Added a function to dump an eaccelerator class entry in debug.c
        * Changed include order in mm.c because of eaccelerator.h include in debug.h 
        * Fixed a nullpointer dereference in some special cases in ea_restore.c:509

2007-01-29  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Removed some obsolete code

2007-01-04  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Happy new-year

2006-11-08  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Enable disassembler links again in the control panel
        * Add some more isset for E_ALL error reporting

2006-11-04  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * It seems I'm longer able to do simple comparisons, this 
          should fix #187 and is a real fix for #182

2006-10-26  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix encoding and decoding of eA and php versions. Only three numbers
          versions were encoded, this way file cache isn't removed when using
          svn snapshots or rc releases.
        * Fix a compile warning when using filename hashing instead of inode 
          hashing.
        * Optimize a part of the inode hashing function.
        * Remove a conditional compile for very old php versions in the filename
          hashing function.
        * Included the new control center written by Thomas Love. It rocks!

2006-10-19  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Replaced short php opening tags in control.php
        * Fixed typo in NEWS file
        * Fix for ticket #170 (handling of multi-dim globals by the optimizer)

2006-10-10  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix a bug in the ttl of the cache. see ticket #182
        * Release version 0.9.5

2006-09-19  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Get session config variables from local values instead of global
          values. This enables altering of session-related settings like
          gc_maxlifetime, entropy_file and entropy_length through ini_set().
          This fixes ticket #166

2006-09-18  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Fixed unbalanced ifdef in eaccelerator.h introduced in rev [269].
          This fixes ticket #177

2006-09-15  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Reverse changeset 205 (doc-comment exclusion) from Tom Regner 
          <t.regner at librics.de>. 
        * only put the function that has the same name as the class as contructor 
          if there isn't a __construct function. This fixes ticket #172
        * Don't free memory with efree that has been allocated from the eA shm cache.
          This should fix A LOT of bugreports in Trac and on SF. It fixes #171 but 
          I think also some other bugs.

2006-08-29  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Skip disk cache creation and clean/clear actions when operating in
          shm_only mode. This fixes ticket #165

2006-08-23  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Fixes for tickets #157 and #164

2006-08-06  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix stupid bug (#159)
        * Handle returning null instead of array (#156)

2006-08-03  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * zend_do_inheritance can't be called with TSRMLS_CC when using 
          php 4, this also means that eAccelerator won't work with threading!
        * ea_info and ea_dasm: if eaccelerator_mm_instance is NULL, just return
          null and don't do something.

2006-07-30  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Don't use our own hash function, the one from the ZE is extremely much
          faster and provides a much better distribution.
        * Don't compile the user cache code one no feature is being compiled.
        * A big cleanup in struct naming
        * Move some functions around to make more of them static, this reduces
          the binary size and load times.
        * Remove some leftovers from restoring encoded scripts which only create
          overhead without the loader.
        * Clean up the session handler, removed old code for php < 4.3. 
        * Fixed detection of SysV IPC shared memory and made anonymous mmap 
          the first selected type. This makes the behaviour of rc1 the 
          default. anonymous mmap doens't have the problem of shmmax. SysVIPC is 
          still available!
        * Fixed some of the detection test in the configure script that probably
          never worked.

2006-07-29  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Use php realpath directly without wrapper, TSRM implements the realpath cache

2006-07-28  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Restore the class entry of zend_property_info when using php 5.2, this fixes bug #151

2006-07-27  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Branched 0.9.5, development for 0.9.6 will start in trunk
        * Bumped up version to 0.9.6-dev
        * Killing the very broken encoder. Once when eAccelerator is in full
          shape an encoder may return.
        * Some fixes to make eAccelerator compile with php 5.2, this fixes bug #150
        * Restore __toString methods correctly with php 5.2
        * Fix bug #145, objects are serialized when they are stored in shared memory.
          Users don't have to do this in their code anymore.
        * Wrong ifdef in compile fix for php 5.2
        * Update config.w32, VC6 and VC2005 project files
        * Fix debug build for win32, this fixes ticket #149
        * Removed a debug statement and added return value in optimizer.c

2006-07-25  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix restoring of opcode handler for php 5.0.5 when files are loaded
          from disk cache. This fixes bug #147
        * Some update in the release notes for the upcoming rc1
        * Fix loader.c too so we don't get any linking errors. 

2006-07-24  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Make clean routine support dir hashing. Again, this should be tested
          on win32!
        * Use a define for the magic string in the eAccelerator file headers
        * Bump up version to 0.9.5-rc1
        * Put -O2 back on for -rc1
        * Update the VC2005 project files
        * Add a config.w32 file for static building of eAccelerator

2006-07-24  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>
        * Fix for ticket #47 and #63, related to problems restoring empty
          strings and empty string array keys from the disk cache.

2006-07-23  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix ticket #143, seems that PHP < 5 doesn't make the extension lower 
          case.

2006-07-22  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Some zval macro's differ for php4 and 5, this fixes #146.
        * Also rewrite clean code for cache files on win32 for directory 
          hashing. This hasn't been tested on windows!!!
        * Added a script to create a bugreport file with more information
          about the userenvironment.

2006-07-19  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Use some more zval macro's to cleanup things a bit
        * Removed the code from mm.c that tried to allocate more then one segment 
          because it didn't work, this part needs a redesign of the mm code to 
          allow this. It should allocate one to init the shared memory and add
          the other to the free list.

2006-07-02  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Made some fixes to ea_info.c to make eA compile on windows again.
          This should fix bug #116.

2006-06-30  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Cleaned up the checking for other incompatible extensions a 
          bit. This should fix the use of IonCube with eAccelerator. I did 
          some test loading IonCube in different ways and never got in to 
          trouble. This fixes ticket #66.

2006-06-30  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Added ability to sort table columns by clicking on the table
          headings in the control panel
        * Quick & dirty fix for eaccelerator_clear to work with the new
          cache dir hashing. This still needs to be done for win32.

          eaccelerator_clean still needs some fixing to work with the
          dir hashing.

2006-06-27  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed ifdef for #108 to use only on windows
        * Fix for bug #109, #31 and SF-1102070
        * Cleaned-up RINIT a bit for hostname determining
        * Included the fix from ticket #94 for zts

2006-06-26  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix ticket #108
        * Removed webui.[c|h] from the windows project files

2006-06-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Fix for ticket #101 ('bailout' is used in zend_globals.h in a ZTS
          build) as suggested by <ihanick at gmail dot com>

2006-06-02  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Removed two unused vars from the internal datastructures
        * Fixed constructor inheritance. This fixes handling of implicit
          constructors and solves ticket #89

2006-05-14  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Forgot to remove some debug messages for the filter bug.

2006-05-08  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Make the disassembler do openbasedir checks before showing a file, 
          this fixes bug #59
        * Changed the filter logic a bit, this fixes bug #72

2006-05-07  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Added directory hashing for md5 and inode based keys based on a patch
          from <mattias at efterfesten.com>, default is 2 levels deep.
        * Renamed some left over MM based names to EA.
        * Increased default hash size for user and script to 512 for extra 
          performance.

2006-05-04  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Don't store the doc_comments in op_array and class_entry. They are 
          useless. this should reduce memory footprint.
        * Included patch from Stadler from ticket #23. It adds a nice menu 
          and code highlighting.

2006-04-13  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * When content cache is used also compiled shared memory functions

2006-04-11  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Fix for 64-bit compilation warnings "cast to pointer from
          integer of different size"

2006-04-11  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * A lot of fixes to silence the compile warnings generated when compiling
          with the default Fedora compiler options
        * Removed FC compiled options from Makefile.in again, stupid me 

2006-04-11  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Silenced the unlock function for win32 until a windows developer can
          take a look at it.
        * Updated the README a little more for the new control panel
        * Added release notes for beta2
        * Bumped up version to 0.9.5-beta2
        * Patch for dasm.php form Stadler, see #23
        * Fixed typo in optimizer which broke compilation for PHP != 5.1
        * Released beta2

2006-04-09  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed some typos in dasm.php
        * Added authentication to the disassembler

2006-04-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Fixed handling of interfaces. This fixes sf.net bug #1440575.
          This fix also introduces some changes in the cached object structure
          so remember to empty your disk caches if you have them. This is
          always a good thing to do after upgrading btw :)

2006-04-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Reverted the change to the handling of ZEND_BRK made by me on
          2006-03-17 since it wasn't working as it should. Since this
          reintroduces sf.net bug #1442923 i added some code to prevent this
          bug using a different approach, by restoring operand types changed
          by build_cfg if build_cfg exits with exit code 0.

          Since php-5.1 some opcode handlers expect a strict set of operand
          types, anything else results in 'Invalid opcode' errors. Since
          build_cfg changes some operand types these changes need to be
          reverted once the optimizer finishes. For now the only opcode to
          which this all applies is ZEND_FETCH_CONSTANT, which expects
          either a CONST or a UNUSED in op1 and a CONST in op2 (See
          zend_vm_def.h)

2006-04-04  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed some error introduced by fixing some win32 stuff :(

2006-04-03  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Moved the FLOCK stuff to a place so it can be used by eLoader to
        * Fixed quite some compile warnings on Win32
        * Updated VC6 project files

2006-03-28  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Removed the constant that were registered in the debug code. They 
          could only be used in php code and not in the config file. This 
          handles bug #29

2006-03-25  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Source code is now shown in dasm.php
        * Added source-code lines to the returned opcode array in ea_dasm.c

2006-03-21  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed bug #24

2006-03-17  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Fix for sf.net bug #1442839 (handling of ZEND_ASSIGN_OBJ by the
          optimizer)
        * Changed BRK handling to not bail out of the optimizer prematurely
          on a multi-level break. This does need some more testing, but
          should fix sf.net bug #1442923
        * Removed some dead code in ea_store.c and excluded some debug code
          from compilation in optimize.c

2006-03-09  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Included fcntl.h in ea_info.c, this should fix bug #13

2006-03-07  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Set refcount to 1 before storing a zval in the usercache. This fixes
          bug #4.
        * Some formatting cleanups in cache.c
        * In restore_zval the zval length could be something else then 0 when 
          an empty string was set.
        * Removed the shorttags in control.php and dasm.php to fix bug #8.
        * Set the svn keywords property to some files.
        * Moved some function defs from eaccelerator.h to the right files.

2006-03-06  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Removed the old webui and made a new controlpanel and disassembler.
        * Added php api documentation

2006-03-02  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Changed copyright dates to 2006
        * Updated the eaccelerator url in some last files
        * I removed all authors from specific files. Authors can be traced 
          through mmcache and eaccelerator cvs. I did this because some 
          names should be added to quite some source files while others have
          added their own while contributing less then the once not mentoined.
          All contributors are credited in the AUTHORS file and specific 
          information can be found in the Changelog and cvs.

2006-03-01  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Bunch of Win32 fixes. It compiles cleanly now (tested with VC++ 6.0)
        * Fix to the optimizer for bug #1439344
        * Fix to ea_store.c for a build problem on RHEL3 reported on the forums at 
          https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3596327

2006-02-28  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Changed the module entry url to eaccelerator.net and year
        * Removed the crash function
        * Disable the keys, session and content cache by default. These could 
          result in a local DoS by cache poisioning

2006-02-24  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Release of eaccelerator 0.9.5-beta1

2006-02-24  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Altered the way debug output is in/excluded by adding a macro that makes
          sure calls to functions like ea_debug_printf don't get compiled in a
          non-debug build. The macro approach was chosen to prevent swamping the
          code with any more ifdef statements. This approach (as opposed to the
          previous empty-function-if-no-debug-build) also makes sure debug function
          arguments such as the tons of getpid()'s (which don't come cheap) don't
          get compiled in and executed in a non-debug build.

2006-02-23  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Don't increase parent refcount in restore_class_parent. This is wrong
          and leads to trouble in the Zend shutdown phase (zend_destroy_class).
          This most likely also fixes the REMOVE_POINTER_FROM_LIST segfault of
          bug #1432758

2006-02-22  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Workaround for "multiple definitions of symbol" thread-safe build
          problem on OSX. This fixes bug #1407520
        * Renamed mm_mutex to ea_mutex to avoid confusion with eA's memory
          manager. This was probably a leftover of mmCache times.

2006-02-21  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Ditched the variadic macros. They were kinda useless now anyway since
          they were only passing one arg. This should make the Win32 folks happy
          since VC6 doesn't seem to support variadic macros (its a C99 thing)
        * Removed some excessive debug output.

2006-02-20  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed bypassing open_basedir restriction when the file was already 
          cached. This fixes bug #1427719
        * Included patch #1435196 to fix the problem of duplicate keys that 
          don't get removed.

2006-02-20  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Fixed static_members handling for php-5.0. Broke this while
          working on PHP-5.1 support. Lost in ifdef statements ;)
        * Fixed ZE1 (<=PHP4) problem regarding parent class lookup during restore.
          Parent classname wasn't lowercased before lookup in class_table. This
          also fixes bug #1432758 (can't restore parent class "stdClass" of class xyz)

2006-02-19  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * Restored PHP4 compatibility
        * Fixed inheritance/prototype issue with abstract methods and classes during
          restore. zend_do_inheritance handles these properly now.

2006-02-18  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Bumped up version to 0.9.5-dev

2006-02-17  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Merged PHP_5_1 branch with HEAD

2006-02-17  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * PHP_5_1: Some final fixes before merging to HEAD:
          - Fixed bug #1410723 (handling of class constants by the optimizer)
          - Fixed backwards compatibility with PHP < 5.1
          This revision works pretty well in my testing environment, PHP-5.1 support
          seems to be coming along quite well. Please test with your applications/
          in your environment and report back with your experiences or possible problems!

2006-02-15 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Released version 0.9.4

2006-02-15  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * PHP_5_1: Fixes for five failing tests found using the test suite created by Bart
          Tests that failed where:
          -ctor_dtor_inheritance (failed because __construct, __destruct and __clone were not properly set)
          -destructor_and_exceptions (failed because inheritance of parent methods was broken, fixed by making sure ea_store doesn't store methods outside scope)
          -inheritance_002 (failed because __construct, __destruct and __clone were not properly set)
          -private_members (failed because __construct, __destruct and __clone were not properly set)
          -type_hinting_003 (failed because array_type_hint introduced in zend_arg_info in PHP-5.1 was ignored)

2006-02-14  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip dot be>

        * PHP_5_1: Changed cflags to -O2 from -O3

        * On failure of mm initialisation, return FAILURE
          instead of disabling eAccelerator.

2006-02-08 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * The owner of the a sysvipc mutex will now be changed on creation of
          of the mutex. The user will be set to the uid set with 
          --with-eaccelerator-userid. This way the semaphore doesn't need to
          be public writable anymore.
        * Moved some inactive contributors to the inactive list.
        * Aplied patch #142200
        * Fixed typo (patch #1409125)
        * Fixed some typos and cleaned up the README file a bit more
        * Fixed some typos in README.eLoader
        * Updated NEWS and bumped up version to 0.9.4-rc2
        * Released 0.9.4-rc2

2006-02-07  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * PHP_5_1: Fix for problems with __autoload
        * PHP_5_1: Fixed compile problems with thread-safe PHP

2006-02-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * PHP_5_1: Quite some major changes, including but probably not limited to:
          -Fixed numerous memory leaks
          -Fixed the handling of empty string variables (as in ""), causing "String is not zero-terminated" warnings when PHP is compiled with --enable-debug
          -More fixes to the handling of static properties (access checking/inheritance)
          -Inheritance on restore is now handled by zend_do_inheritance
          -Fixed handling of ZEND_OP_DATA and ZEND_INIT_METHOD_CALL by the optimizer
          -Cosmetic fixes (spelling etc.)

2006-01-16  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * PHP_5_1: Fix for bug #1401474 (and most likely some more php-5.1 related trouble)
          static_members handling was incorrect.

2006-01-12  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>

        * First batch of PHP-5.1 related changes committed to the newly created
          PHP_5_1 branch. This is a work in progress, so YMMV.

2006-01-10 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix for bug #1366008
        * Fix for bug #1238736, when a log file is set eA will lock it
          before writing to it.

2005-11-22 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Disabled the cache dir check, to much people complaining
        * fixed eLoader

2005-11-22 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Some compile fixes from Chmouel Boudjnah

2005-11-20 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * check_cache_dir is only done when shm_only = 0
        * Only eA is disabled when init of shared mem or cache check fails
        * Released 0.9.4-rc1

2005-11-20 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Removed executor hooks, they weren't used anyway.
        * Check if eA has a valid cache directory.
        * Make the init of php fail if the initialisation of the shared memory
          or cache directory failes.
        * set shared memory size in eaccelerator.ini to 0 so the default OS
          size is used.
        * README updates
        * Updated version to 0.9.4-rc1

2005-11-17 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed optimizer bug with php 5.0.5

2005-11-16 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Patch for including files in same directory (#1259695) from Alexy

2005-11-15 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Spinlock test now tests for i386 and x86_64. Because spinlocks where
          never used on 64-bit and sysv ipc locking didn't work, there were a 
          lot of problems.

2005-10-20 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * The two error message added to see if a lock has failed made configure 
          fail to compile the shared memory test.

2005-10-13 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed the php5 optimizer bug.
        * Changed semaphore permissions to 0666 so sysvipc locks work. Working 
          locks seem a bit more important than making the semaphore public. (#1295970)
        * Added error messages when a lock can't be aquired or released.

2005-08-03 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Included some compile fixes. (Thanks Matt)
        * Included patch from the hardened php guys to make eA work
          with hardened php.

2005-07-11 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * ea_store.c and ea_restore.c functions clean up
        * extraced restore_class_parent and restore_class_methods from
          restore_class_entry to share code with loader.c
        * extracted opcode handling in encode/decode_op_array into 
          encode/decode_op to make code more readable
        * make decode_class_entry use new functions in ea_restore.c
        * readded line-number encoding
        * bumped up encoder version to 4 until new loader is in place

2005-07-10 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Renamed some macros from MMC (mmcache) to EA (eg MMCG is now EAG)
        * Added eA file header to mm.c, mm.h and x86-spinlocks.h
        * Readded a hack to the loader to prevent zend2 segfaults

2005-07-09 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * A compile fix for php4 (bug #1235017)
        * Removed atexit code that only produced segfaults and didn't work
          (Patch from Rob Foehl <rwf at loonybin.net>)
        * Code clean up and compile fixes for VC.net + VC.net project files update
          (Based on patch #1234919)
        * Future check warning was done on uninitialised buf.
        * Some code clean ups and updated VS6 project files.

2005-07-07 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Added get_zend_destroy_property_info function to ea_restore.h
        * Code refactoring needed for the new encoder. Moved all store/calc
          functions to ea_store.c and all restore/fixup functions to ea_restore.c

2005-07-06 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * A compile fix for zend engine 1.
        * Documented namespace option
        * New debug/log code. Make the code a lot cleaner and easier
          for the user to debug eaccelerator.

2005-06-27 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixed a buffer overflow in eaccelerator.c and cache.c. A string longer
          then 8 bytes was copied in a char array of length 8. This isn't a
          security risk because the overflowed bytes were directly overwritten
          by other values. This fixes bug 1228096 which was caused by the 
          bufferoverflow detection in FC4. 
          http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-09/msg02055.html

2005-06-24 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * The future check is removed because mtime are only checked on changes
          so caching files from the future isn't a problem.

2005-06-23 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Applied patch 1226111
        * Added a warning message when php scripts have a modification time in
          in the future and the debug is enabled.

2005-06-20 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Set the test value shared memory to 32mb instead of 64mb because the
          test will fail on 2.6 kernels where 32mb is the default value. (#1203253)
        * Reverted the patch for the gc_maxlifetime setting when using
          user functions for the session handler. I can't find a way to
          access the current value instead of the ini setting.
          Using the session api is the preffered session handling way anyway.

2005-05-22 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Bumped version to 0.9.4-dev
        * Changed hash_mm prototype in eaccelerator.h to non-inline (Compaq c compiler)
        * Fixes from patch 1206311 + some unused variable clean ups

2005-05-18 Franck Tabary <franck34 at users.sourceforge.net>

        * released eAccelerator 0.9.3 final

2005-05-16 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Added --without-eaccelerator-use-inode configure switch to disable the use
          of inode numbers for the hash keys (Feature request 1201159). The default
          behaviour doesn't change.
        * Fix for bug 1202296 based on patch 1202708

2005-05-15 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Compile fix for bug 1201564.

2005-05-14 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * The session lifetime patch only fixed the problem when using one type of session handler. It's now 
          also fixed for the other type of session handler.

2005-05-12 Franck Tabary <franck34 at users.sourceforge.net>

        * released eAccelerator 0.9.3-rc2

2005-05-11 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fix for must constructor related problems with encoded scripts and php5. Also a fixes
          memory leak in the loader. (Thanks larnot)

2005-05-10 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>
    
        * Added some includes to satisfy VC.NET (thanks to dakalka, patch 1198522)
        * This patch adds the right destructor for the propertiesinfo hashtable, but it doesn't fix bug 1179270
        * Updated README.win32 with some extra information from Larnot

2005-05-09 Franck Tabary <franck34 at users.sourceforge.net>

        * released eAccelerator 0.9.3-rc1

2005-05-09 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Fixes the segfault when loading encoded script with eloader and php5
        * Commited README.win32 with instructions to compile eAccelerator on windows
        * Add the destructor to properties info hashtable in restore_class_entry, fixes bug 1179270

2005-05-06 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Patch fixing eLoader compilation.

2005-05-05 Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * This patch fixes some stuff concerning configuration. With this patch 
          some parts that are forgotten with the code split are fixed. 
          They are also needed to compile eA with VC. The other stuff should make it possible 
          to compile eA as a static module for php.
        * Updated VC project files

2005-05-02  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * Patch fixing php 5 constructor problems. Fixes bugs 1179264, 1121757 and 1099693
        * Added switch -w to encoder so you can encode file without the check for eloader. This is 
          based on patch 1191147 with some fixes.

2005-04-26  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>

        * The first part of the code refactoring. In this part the monolitic 
          eaccelerator.c file has been split up in more logical blocks.
          - cache.c/cache.h contains the procedure for shm.c/session.c/content.c to add user_cache entries to the ea cache
          - shm.c/shm.h contains the eaccelerator shared memory functions
          - session.c/session.h contains the session related stuff
          - webui.c/webui.h contains all stuff related to the webinterface and disassembler
          - debug.c/debug.h contains some procedures to print debug information
          - content.h contains the php content caching prototype instead of eaccelerator.h
        * Added --without-eaccelerator-shared-memory and  --without-eaccelerator-webui configure switches
        
        Bugfixes included:
        * Patch 1188510 eaccelerator_compile_file typos
        * Patch 1189792 session life time patch
        * Patch 1167069 HAS_ATTRIBUTE fix with FreeBSD 4.x
        * Patch 1166707 loader patch for OOP functions in PHP5
        * Patch 1173095 mm_alloc & mm_free clash with libirc
        * Fix for 1178588, 1153030 and patch 1189852. Fixes the endless loop when reseting a non array.
          The optimisation for that caused this is removed for zend engine 2 and 1 because 
          php >= 4.3.11 is also affected, so this will be useless in some time.

2005-01-14  Shin Seung Woo <segv74 at gmail.com>

        * fixes 1099498 Problems with IMP H3 (Horde) when restarting apache2
          ( bug was lied on fix_zval(), it didn't check IS_CONSTANT_INDEX flag. )

        Fixed following bugs:
        * 1092128 Horde-hashs int the sourcecode of eaccelerator.c
        * 1091960 include_once include files multiple times
