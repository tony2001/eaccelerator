 * Released 0.9.5-beta1

    The first beta in the history of eAccelerator! This release mainly contains
    support for php 5.1 and some small bugfixes that got fixed along the way.
    This version fully passes the PHP 5.1 test suite so it's time to have a 
    broader public testing the code.
    Most work has been done by Hans Rakers based on patches from Xuefer and 
    Bart. Lyle also contributed some fixes.
    We feel this release is already more stable and better compatible with 
    PHP 5 and 5.1 then the 0.9.4 release. We hope to make a stable release 
    soon. The encoder hasn't received any love so it's still only compatible 
    with PHP 4!. Please report all bug back to us.

 * Released 0.9.4

    This release only contains some bugfixes and code cleanups. This release
    is still the old codebase. It doesn't contain any new code yet.
    - Some fixed were done to the encoder. The format changed a bit so I bumped
      up the encoder version. Because the encoder still isn't functional for
      php version other than php 4 you should only use this encoder if you want
      to have line numbers encoded.
      In next versions we will try to fix the encoder for php 5 and 5.1
    - eA should be php 5 compatible except some very unusual cases.
    - This version DOESN'T support php 5.1
