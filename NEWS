 * Released 0.9.4

    This release only contains some bugfixes and code cleanups. This release
    is still the old codebase. It doesn't contain any new code yet.
    - Some fixed were done to the encoder. The format changed a bit so I bumped
      up the encoder version. Because the encoder still isn't functional for
      php version other than php 4 you should only use this encoder if you want
      to have line numbers encoded.
      In next versions we will try to fix the encoder for php 5 and 5.1
    - eA should be php 5 compatible except some very unusual cases.
    - This version DOESN'T support php 5.1
